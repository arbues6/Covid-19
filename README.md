# Covid-19 - Basic Data Science
Hi there, 

If you always wanted to learn about data science, AI and basic programming, and at the moment, you are stuck at home thinking 24/7 about Covid-19... You came to the appropriate repository!

With really simple steps, and using a Python Notebook (.ipynb), you'll learn how to cluster covid-19 curves and predict (unfortunately) some scenarios of confirmed cases for any desired country. This is a non-lucrative project and all data was collected from a Kaggle dataset (which is updated every single day) and World Bank. 

The only dependencies are Python itself (tested on 3.7), Jupyter Notebooks, and Numpy, Csv and Scikit-Learn Python libraries.  

I hope you enjoy it! If you have any questions, please don't hesitate contacting me (adria.arbues@upf.edu). Cheers!
